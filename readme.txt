On a category's archive page, displays only the posts directly in that category, not in any sub-categories.

== Description ==

Just One Category will cause WordPress to display on a category archive page 
*only* those posts which are direct members of that category, i.e. this plugin 
will exclude from that category page all posts which belong to any of that 
category's subcategories but *do not* belong to the category itself.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin to your plugins folder: `wp-content/plugins/`
2. Make sure the file has sufficient 
<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions">File Permissions</a> 
to be read by your web server (you probably don't have to worry about this step).
3. Activate the plugin ('Just One Category') from your 
<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins">Plugin Manager</a> in your
<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Panels">Administration Panels</a>.
4. That should be it.  No plugin configuration is necessary.
